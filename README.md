# To Do List App

I created a simple and responsive **To Do List App** using **HTML**, **CSS** and
**JavaScript**. This app allows users to add and delete tasks. Data is stored in **sessionStorage** so tasks persist across the browser session.

## Features

- Add new tasks

- Mark tasks as completed

- Delete tasks

- Automatically saves tasks using sessionStorage

- Clean and responsive UI

- Interactive task selection with custom icons

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the app

- **CSS3**: Styling and layout

- **JavaScript**: Functionality and interactivity

- **Session Storage**: Temporary data persistence

## How It Works

1. Enter a task in the input field.

2. Click the Add button to add the task.

3. Click on a task to mark it as completed.

4. Click the ❌ icon to delete a task.

5. Tasks are saved automatically using sessionStorage.

## JavaScript Logic Overview

- Event Listeners handle adding, checking, and deleting tasks.

- sessionStorage stores the task list as HTML.

- Tasks reload automatically when the page refreshes (within the same session).

## Future Improvements

1. Edit existing tasks

2. Add due dates or priorities

3. Store data using backend

4. Mobile-first enhancements

5. Dark mode
6. Add keydown event
